Introduction
------------
MAmotif is used to compare two ChIP-seq samples of the same protein from different cell types
(or conditions, e.g. wild-type vs mutant) and identify transcriptional factors (TFs) associated
with the cell type-biased binding of this protein as its co-factors, by using TF binding information obtained from
motif analysis (or from other ChIP-seq data). MAmotif automatically combines MAnorm model to perform quantitative
comparison on input ChIP-seq samples together with Motif-Scan toolkit to scan ChIP-seq peaks for TF binding motifs,
and uses a systematic integrative analysis to search for TFs whose binding sites are significantly associated with
the cell type-biased peaks between two ChIP-seq samples. When applying to ChIP-seq data of histone marks of
regulatory elements (such as H3K4me3 for active promoters and H3K9/27ac for active promoters and enhancers),
or DNase/ATAC-seq data, MAmotif can be used to detect cell type-specific regulators .

Installation
------------

The latest version release of MAmotif is available at
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mamotif>`__:

::

    $ pip install mamotif

MAmoitf uses `setuptools <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ for installation from source code.
The source code of MAmoitf is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/shao-lab/MAmotif

You can clone the repo and execute the following command under source directory:

::

    $ python setup.py install

Usage
-----

Build genomes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you use MAmotif, you need to build the prerequisites for  corresponding genome assembly.

::

    $ genomecompile [-h] [-v] -G sequences.fa -o output_dir

A directory contaning compiled genome sequence and information would be generated by this command.

**Note:** You only need run it once for each genome.

Build motif PWM (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Note:** MAmoitf provides some preprocessed motif PWM files under data/motif of the MotifScan package.

IF you have some motifs that have not be included in our pre-complied motif collection, you need to compile on your own by using the following command.

::

    $ motifcompile –M motif_pwm_demo.txt –g hg19_for_motifscan

-M motif raw matrix file

-g a pre-compiled genome directory generated by genomecompile

Motif raw matrix file should follow the format as below:

motif id and motif name are followed by a positive weighted matrix, and columns are seperated by tabs.

run MAmotif
^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    $ mamoitf --p1 sample1_peaks.bed --p2 sample2_peaks.bed --r1 sample1_reads.bed --r2 sample2_reads.bed -g hg19_for_motifscan –m motif_pwm_demo.txt -o sample1_vs_sample2

**Note:** Using -h/--help for the details of all arguments.
